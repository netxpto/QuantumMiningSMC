Short term goal: simulate in VHDL IDE environment => simulation in Netxpto => implementation in the FPGA => validation in the lab
Medium term goal: implement the QBER estimation module in the FPGA

2018-12-19

	- put in the open issues the state of project, mention that you need 4 generic I/O interfaces


2018-12-13

	- try to improve the specifications

	- obtan the license to generate the bicode to the FPGA

	- think about a way to read the parameters from the configuration file

Next meeting: 19/12, 11h30m



2018-12-06

	- finish the specification / documentation / include and explain the simulation results

	- upload it to the FPGA (start the tests in the FPGA) / Celestino

	- think about a way to read the parameters from the configuration file

	- prepare the slides for the 12/12, Wedndesday, 2.30 pm, 5 slides
		1-> title
		2-> purpose
		3/4-> architecture
		5-> the state of the work

	(come to my office, Monday morning or Tuesday afternoon to show the slides)

next meeting: 13/12, 9.00 am

2018-11-26


	work on the documentation (make clear which are the customizable parameters)

	test and integrate all blocks

	do the simulation VHDL IDE (to make sure the all blocks are working properly)
