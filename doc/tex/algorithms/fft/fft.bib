abstract = {The hardware description and modeling of digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms and applications for implementing on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips are challenging issues. In this paper, some practical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms including Cooley-Tukey, Good-Thomas, Radix-2 and Rader methods are modeled by Verilog hardware description language and their performance are compared in terms of chip area utilization and maximum frequency operation. The results of synthesizing FFT algorithms by ISE tool on XC3S5000 chip, from XILINX Inc. demonstrate that the Radix-2 FFT method uses the least number of Slices and the Cooley-Tukey and Good-Thomas approaches use the most number of Slices. In term of Flip-Flop utilization, the Cooley-Tukey and Good-Thomas approaches use less than the Radix-2 and Rader approaches. Furthermore, for all methods, the utilized FPGA chip area increases by increasing the number of FFT points. The Radix-2 is the fastest method for calculating FFT. The Good-Thomas method is faster than Cooley-Tukey where there are no coefficients between DFT blocks and the Rader method has the worst operating frequency on FPGA between all proposed FFT approaches.},

@book{Rao2010a,
abstract = {Fast Fourier Transform - Algorithms and Applications presents an introduction to the principles of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). It covers FFTs, frequency domain filtering, and applications to video and audio signal processing. As fields like communications, speech and image processing, and related areas are rapidly developing, the FFT as one of the essential parts in digital signal processing has been widely used. Thus there is a pressing need from instructors and students for a book dealing with the latest FFT topics. Fast Fourier Transform - Algorithms and Applications provides a thorough and detailed explanation of important or up-to-date FFTs. It also has adopted modern approaches like MATLAB examples and projects for better understanding of diverse FFTs. Fast Fourier Transform - Algorithms and Applications is designed for senior undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, engineers, and scientists in the field, and self-learners to understand FFTs and directly apply them to their fields, efficiently. It is designed to be both a text and a reference. Thus examples, projects and problems all tied with MATLAB, are provided for grasping the concepts concretely. It also includes references to books and review papers and lists of applications, hardware/software, and useful websites. By including many figures, tables, bock diagrams and graphs, this book helps the reader understand the concepts of fast algorithms readily and intuitively. It provides new MATLAB functions and MATLAB source codes. The material in Fast Fourier Transform - Algorithms and Applications is presented without assuming any prior knowledge of FFT. This book is for any professional who wants to have a basic understanding of the latest developments in and applications of FFT. It provides a good reference for any engineer planning to work in this field, either in basic implementation or in research and development.},
