abstract = {Digital filters underpin the performance of coherent optical receivers which exploit digital signal processing (DSP) to mitigate transmission impairments. We outline the principles of such receivers and review our experimental investigations into compensation of polarization mode dispersion. We then consider the details of the digital filtering employed and present an analytical solution to the design of a chromatic dispersion compensating filter. Using the analytical solution an upper bound on the number of taps required to compensate chromatic dispersion is obtained, with simulation revealing an improved bound of 2.2 taps per 1000ps/nm for 10.7GBaud data. Finally the principles of digital polarization tracking are outlined and through simulation, it is demonstrated that 100krad/s polarization rotations could be tracked using DSP with a clock frequency of less than 500MHz.},

abstract = {The digital coherent receivers combine coherent detection with digital signal processing (DSP) to compensate for transmission impairments, and therefore are a promising candidate for future high-speed optical transmission system. However, the maximum symbol rate supported by such real-time receivers is limited by the processing rate of hardware. In order to cope with this difficulty, the parallel processing algorithms is imperative. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel digital timing recovery loop (PDTRL) based on our previous work. Furthermore, for increasing the dynamic dispersion tolerance range of receivers, we embed a parallel adaptive equalizer in the PDTRL. This parallel joint scheme (PJS) can be used to complete synchronization, equalization and polarization de-multiplexing simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that PDTRL and PJS allow the hardware to process 112G bit/s POLMUX-DQPSK signal at the hundreds MHz range.},

abstract={We study a carrier-synchronization scheme for coherent optical communications that uses a feedforward architecture that can be implemented in digital hardware without a phase-locked loop. We derive the equations for maximum a posteriori joint detection of the transmitted symbols and the carrier phase. The result is a multidimensional optimization problem that we approximate with a two-stage iterative algorithm: The first stage is a symbol-by-symbol soft detector of the carrier phase, and the second stage is a hard-decision phase estimator that uses prior and subsequent soft-phase decisions to obtain a minimum mean-square-error phase estimate by exploiting the temporal correlation in the phase-noise process. The received symbols are then derotated by the hard-decision phase estimates, and maximum- likelihood sequence detection of the symbols follows. As each component in the carrier-recovery unit can be separately optimized, the resulting system is highly flexible. We show that the optimum hard-decision phase estimator is a linear filter whose impulse response consists of a causal and an anticausal exponential sequence, which we can truncate and implement as an finite-impulse- response filter. We derive equations for the phase-error variance and the system bit-error ratio (BER). Our results show that 4, 8, and 16 quadrature-amplitude-modulation (QAM) transmissions at 1 dB above sensitivity for BER = 10-3 is possible with laser beat linewidths of DeltanuTb = 1.3 X 10-4, 1.3 X 10-4, and 1.5 x 105 when a decision-directed soft-decision phase estimator is employed.},

abstract="Assuming that Alice and Bob use a secret noisy channel (modelled by a binary symmetric channel) to send a
key, reconciliation is the process of correcting errors between Alice's and Bob's version of the key. This is done by
public discussion, which leaks some information about the secret key to an eavesdropper. We show how to construct
protocols that leak a minimum amount of information. However this construction cannot be implemented efficiently. If
Alice and Bob are willing to reveal an arbitrarily small amount of additional information (beyond the minimum) then
they can implement polynomial-time protocols. We also present a more efficient protocol, which leaks an amount of
information acceptably close to the minimum possible for sufficiently reliable secret channels (those with
probability of any symbol being transmitted incorrectly as large as 15{\%}). This work improves on earlier
reconciliation approaches [R, BBR, BBBSS].",

abstract="Nearest private query is a special private query which involves two parties, a user and a data owner, where the user has a private input (e.g., an integer) and the data owner has a private data set, and the user wants to query which element in the owner's private data set is the nearest to his input without revealing their respective private information. In this paper, we first present a quantum protocol for nearest private query, which is based on quantum oblivious key distribution (QOKD). Compared to the classical related protocols, our protocol has the advantages of the higher security and the better feasibility, so it has a better prospect of applications.",
