\section{Single Photon Receiver}

This block of code simulates the reception of two time continuous signals which are the outputs of single photon detectors and decode them in measurements results. A simplified schematic representation of this block is shown in figure \ref{SPR_receiver_block_diagram_simple}.

\subsection*{Functional description}

This block accepts two time continuous input signals and outputs one time discrete signal that corresponds to the single photon detection measurements demodulation of the input signal. It is a complex block (as it can be seen from figure \ref{SPR_receiver_block_diagram_simple} of code made up of several simpler blocks whose description can be found in the \textit{lib} repository.

In can also be seen from figure \ref{SPR_receiver_block_diagram_simple} that there are two extra internal input signals generated by the \textit{Clock} in order to keep all blocks synchronized. This block is used to provide the sampling frequency to the \textit{Sampler} blocks.


\subsection*{Input parameters}

This block has some input parameters that can be manipulated by the user in order to change the basic configuration of the receiver. Each parameter has associated a function that allows for its change. In the following table (table~\ref{table}) the input parameters and corresponding functions are summarized.
