\subsection*{Functional Description}
The structure of the beam splitter can be controlled with the parameter mode.\\
When \textbf{Mode = 0} the beam splitter will have one input port and two output ports - \textbf{1x2 Beam Splitter}. If Mode has a value different than 0, the splitter will have two input ports and two output ports - \textbf{2x2 Beam Splitter}.\\
Considering the first case, the matrix representing a 2x2 Beam Splitter can be summarized in the following way,

\begin{equation}
M_{BS}=~\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\begin{bmatrix}
              					1  & 1 \\
            					1 & -1
            			  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
The relation between the values of the input ports and the values of the output ports can be established in the following way

\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
A' \\
B'
\end{bmatrix}=M_{BS} \dot{}{\begin{bmatrix}
			  				     A \\
			  	                 B
			  	                 \end{bmatrix}}
\end{equation}
Where, A and B represent the inputs and A' and B' represent the outputs of the Beam Splitter.
