abstract="Recognizing cryptographic algorithm from the binary codes plays an important role in checking the malicious
codes and protecting the security of computer systems. This paper firstly introduces the current situation about the
algorithm recognition and characteristic-code checking, makes use of the software reverse-engineering technology in
order to extract the characteristic-codes from all kinds of the cryptographic algorithms and builds up the static
characteristic database about the cryptographic algorithms. Then the paper introduces Boyer-Moore matching algorithm
to design a scanning tool for the cryptographic algorithms, tests its efficiency and discusses the corresponding
reliability; finally, the paper points out the developmental direction for algorithm recognition and technologies,
which will be adopted in the field of software reverse engineering.",

abstract="Assuming that Alice and Bob use a secret noisy channel (modelled by a binary symmetric channel) to send a
key, reconciliation is the process of correcting errors between Alice's and Bob's version of the key. This is done by
public discussion, which leaks some information about the secret key to an eavesdropper. We show how to construct
protocols that leak a minimum amount of information. However this construction cannot be implemented efficiently. If
Alice and Bob are willing to reveal an arbitrarily small amount of additional information (beyond the minimum) then
they can implement polynomial-time protocols. We also present a more efficient protocol, which leaks an amount of
information acceptably close to the minimum possible for sufficiently reliable secret channels (those with
probability of any symbol being transmitted incorrectly as large as 15{\%}). This work improves on earlier
reconciliation approaches [R, BBR, BBBSS].",
