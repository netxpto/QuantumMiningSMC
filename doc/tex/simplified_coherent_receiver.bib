abstract = {The interest for short-reach links of the kind needed for inter-data-center communications has fueled in recent years the search for transmission schemes that are simultaneously highly performing and cost effective. In this work we propose a direct-detection coherent receiver that combines the advantages of coherent transmission and the cost-effectiveness of direct detection. The working principle of the proposed receiver is based on the famous Kramers–Kronig (KK) relations, and its implementation requires transmitting a continuous-wave signal at one edge of the information-carrying signal spectrum. The KK receiver scheme allows digital postcompensation of linear propa-gation impairments and, as compared to other existing solutions, is more efficient in terms of spectral occupancy and energy consumption.},

abstract = {—We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a band-limited function E(t) being of minimum phase, and hence for its phase being univocally determined by its intensity |E(t)| 2 . This condition is based on the knowledge of E(t) alone and not of its analytic continuation in the complex plane, thus greatly simplifying its practical applicability. We apply these results to find the class of all band-limited signals that correspond to distinct receiver states when the detector is sensitive to the field intensity only and insensitive to the field phase, and discuss the performance of a recently proposed transmission scheme able to linearly detect all distinguishable states.},
